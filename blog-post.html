            <p>Like the iPhone X and its notch, the <strong>iPhone 11 Pro and iPhone 11 Pro Max</strong> have a controversial design that
              seems to have divided everyone.</p>
            <p>A lot of people don’t like the way the three lenses protrude in a squircle-shaped bump that also houses
              the LED flash and microphone. The holes are reportedly triggering people’s trypophobia (fear of clusters
              of holes and bumps).</p>
            <p>I’m not dismissing trypophobia, but having used the iPhone 11 Pro and 11 Pro Max for a week ahead of its
              release, I can definitively say everyone needs to chill out.</p>
            <p>Almost everyone I’ve shown the iPhone 11 Pro to say it’s not as offensive in person — the lens rings
              aren’t nearly as thick as closeup images make them appear — and the design is one of a kind (for now).</p>
            <p>The fact that I literally couldn’t go anywhere in New York City without drawing attention from people who
              spotted the triple cameras suggests the iPhone 11 Pros already have what Android phones could only dream
              of: celebrity status.</p>
            <p>Once you get over the camera bump, you'll see the iPhone 11 Pro and 11 Pro Max are more <em>"pro"</em> than meets
              the eye. I'll take the most versatile camera system, the longest battery life of any iPhone, and the most
              secure mobile operating system over a new design that's different for the sake of being different any day.

              PRETTIER IN PERSON
            </h2>
            <p>Ignore the noise you hear online. The <strong>iPhone 11 Pro and 11 Pro Max</strong> are way better looking in person,
              after you’ve held one in your hands, and used its weirdly aligned triple cameras (there is a reason why
              they’re like that, which I’ll get into soon).</p>
            <p>Just as everyone immediately pounced on Apple for the iPhone X's notch and then learned to accept it, I
              guarantee the same will happen with the iPone 11 Pro and 11 Pro Max’s triple cameras.</p>
            <p>I’m confident about this because people have been complaining about camera bumps — a <em>“pragmatic
              optimization”</em> according to outgoing Apple Chief Design Officer Jony Ive — since the iPhone 6’s tiny lens
              protrusion.</p>
            <p>I, myself, have chronicled the evolution of the iPhone’s growing camera bumps over the years, and guess
              what? I always got over the knee-jerk criticism because I value photography. If you’re a parent, I'm
              positive you’ll care more about how the iPhone 11 Pro’s camera captures photos and videos of your kids
              than how the bump looks.</p>

            <h2 class="heading-secondary">BEYOND HUMAN SIGHT AND SOUND</h2>
            <h3 class="heading-tertiary">FOUR CAMERAS IN ONE</h3>
            <p>Let's not waste any more time, and talk about the iPhone 11 Pro and 11 Pro Max's cameras. There are four
              cameras on each phone — <u>three on the rear and one on the front</u>.</p>
            <p>On the back, the triple camera consists of the following:</p>
            <ul class="content-list">
              <li><u>12-megapixel</u> "wide" camera with f/1.8 aperture with optical image stabilization (OIS)
              </li>
              <li><u>12-megapixel</u> "2x telephoto" camera f/2.0 aperture with OIS
              </li>
              <li><u>12-megapixel</u> "ultra wide" camera with f/2.4 aperture and 120-degree field of view
              </li>
            </ul>

            <h3 class="heading-tertiary">“PRO” WHERE IT MATTERS</h3>
            <p>You don’t need me to tell you the iPhone 11 Pro and 11 Pro Max are the most advanced iPhones ever.
              Because of course they are.</p>
            <blockquote>
              What you’re likely wondering is whether or not Apple’s latest and greatest are worthy of the “pro” name.
              If you’ve read the entirety of this review, it’s pretty obvious they are.
            </blockquote>
            <p>With a versatile triple-camera system, noticeably longer battery life, powerful A13 Bionic performance,
              and even better display, the iPhone 11 Pro and 11 Pro Max rightfully earn their premium pricing.</p>
            <p>There are for sure arguments to be made that Apple isn’t pushing the envelope on design again, instead
              choosing to reuse the iPhone X’s two-year-old look, with just a change to the glass texture and camera
              bump.</p>
